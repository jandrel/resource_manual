Review Software
    Oxford Abstracts
    What was there before and why?
Public-facing GDHS website (MSU Reclaim)

Trello Board

with the review software, we changed about 3 years ago and there was a lot of research done in the process. we should have some of this here so that if we need to change things around, this would be useful to know.

Oxford abstracts is also used for registration, not just review. but we also post the presentation abstracts on our website and recodings on youtube with presenter permissions.

All of this should be explained here with examples.
