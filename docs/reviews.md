## Reviews and Oxford Abstracts ##
The Global Digital Humanities Symposium uses Oxford Abstracts for managing abstract submissions, peer review, and registration for the symposium. As a platform, Oxford Abstracts enables reviewer assignment, anonymous and shared feedback, and a structure for cross-reviewing that is helpful for decision making. 

### Sample Review Timeline ###
October 15 - Proposals Due
October - Reviewer Recruitment
November 13 - Reviews Due (Reviewers given ~1 month to complete reviews)
November (11/18-11/20) - Decision Days
December 1 - Notification to Submitters


## How the GDHS finds reviewers ##
* Reviewer recruitment
  <!-- we could mention when this begins, who is an ideal candadite for reviewing, past reviewers, etc.  -->
* "Sign up to Review" form through Oxford Abstracts.

## Review Process ##

### Proposal Guidelines ###
"As a community, the Global Digital Humanities Symposium is committed to supporting work at the intersections of critical DH; race and ethnicity; feminism, intersectionality, and gender; disability justice; access and preservation; and, anticolonial and postcolonial frameworks. We approach the humanities with an interdisciplinary lens, and we welcome scholarship and projects that work across borders.

Your proposal will be reviewed by members of the Global Digital Humanities Community. Their feedback will be taken into consideration when the conference organizers make their final decisions. If your proposal is selected, this abstract will be published online on the conference website."

### Reviewers will evaluate proposals based on the following criteria ###
