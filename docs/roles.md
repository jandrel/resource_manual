The GDHS takes place across three sites: virtually on Zoom, in-person at Michigan State University, and in-person at an international host institution outside of the United States. The organization is structured to support this multi-site model through a dual committee system and event-specific volunteer roles. The **Planning Committee** meets weekly and handles operational tasks and detailed symposium coordination. The **Advisory Committee** meets on a monthly basis and provides strategic guidance. Both committees work collaboratively to ensure successful Symposium planning and execution. **International host institution** has its own internal organization team, with point people from that team serving in the Planning Committee. Future international host institutions have at least one representative in the Advisory Committee to support knowledge transfer and continuity across years. Volunteers are selected from members and friends of the GDHS and serve specific roles to help run the in-person and online components of the symposium.

## Planning Committee

The Planning Committee meets weekly and is responsible for the detailed coordination and execution of the symposium. Members are organized into local teams based on the Symposium's three sites, with each member holding both a local team assignment and an individual functional role.

<!-- I summarized this from the doc that Kristen shared. A few years back when I was on the Planning committee, there were 4 subcommittees. Is that still the case? -->

### Committee Structure

Each Planning Committee member has:

* A **local team assignment** (MSU Local, International Host Local, or Global Community/Virtual)
* An **individual functional role** (e.g., Website Point Person, Program Point Person, Communications Coordinator)

[HELP] This structure replaced subcommittees? Under each point person there is a team?

### International Host Institution Representation

* Each hosting institution has at least 2 Planning Committee members
* Example: For the 2026 Symposium, 2 UDEM representatives served on the Planning Committee

### Local Teams

Each of the Symposium's three sites is managed by a team of three people responsible for that site's logistics.

#### Team Responsibilities

Each local team has a **point person** who:

* Ensures the team's work gets done
* Serves as primary contact with venues and vendors
* Is supported by other team members who have additional primary roles on the committee

**For in-person teams (MSU and International Host):**

* Book spaces
* Coordinate technology
* Order catering
* Recruit volunteers
* Coordinate keynote logistics
* Create run-of-show documents for their day

**For the virtual/global community team:**

* Plan Zoom logistics
* Coordinate networking sessions
* Conduct outreach to global DH communities
* Arrange stage managers and emcees
* Work with interpreters
* Create run-of-show documents for virtual days

<!-- For both of these, are these summarizes enough? I feel like I need to expand upon this more, like describing stuff like run-of-show documents -->

### Individual Functional Roles

Planning Committee members hold functional roles that span the entire Symposium operation. Note that these roles involve ensuring work gets done rather than doing every task personally. Extensive documentation and templates from previous years are available to support this work.

<!-- Should I link to some documentation here -->

**Core functional roles include:**

* MSU Local Point Person
* International Host Local Point Person
* Global Community/Virtual Point Person
* Presenter Point of Contact & Proceedings Editor
* Website Point Person
* Reviewers Point Person
* Program Point Person
* Communications & Social Media Coordinator

## Advisory Committee

The direction of the Symposium is informed by an Advisory Committee of 12 people. The purpose of the Advisory Committee is to include more voices - especially from around the globe -  involved in the decisions of planning the Symposium. The Planning Committee will consult the Advisory Committee on matters such as the call for proposals, budget, outreach initiatives, schedule of events, and on any other matter of importance.

Responsibilities and expectations of Advisory Committee members include:

* Respond in a timely fashion to scheduling polls for monthly meeting
* Attend monthly virtual committee meetings (1 hour meetings)
* Engage in discussion and provide feedback about Symposium planning activities at monthly meetings and/or via email
* Attend the Symposium (virtually and/or in person)
* Commit to a full year of activity (June 2025 - May 2026, including during the northern hemisphere summer).
<!-- here I used the language from the form but it is specific to the 2025-6 dates. how should we change it? -->

### Composition

* ~12 Advisory Committee members
* Co-chairs
* At least 1 representative from the next year's international hosting institution (serves one year prior to their institution's hosting year)

### Application Process

Applications for the Advisory Committee open after the end of the academic year in which the Symposium took place. The Advisory Committee is an opportunity to become more involved in the Symposium, learning about its ethos and contributing to its future. Those who have presented at or reviewed for the Symposium in the past are especially encouraged to serve in the Advisory Committee. To apply, fill out the Advisory Committee application form by the posted deadline (typically early June) or contact the Symposium co-chairs with questions about the application process.

## International Host Institution
<!-- external or international? what are we thinking about the emphasis outside of the US? -->

Starting in 2026, the GDHS expanded beyond its historic home at Michigan State University to include an international host institution as part of the in-person event. This partnership model allows the Symposium to reach new audiences around the world while maintaining its commitment to accessible, collaborative global digital humanities scholarship.

Host institutions are responsible for providing venue space, local staffing, and logistical support for their site, including a presentation room for 80+ attendees, catering space, and at least two representatives to serve on the Planning Committee. The Symposium provides support through MSU including travel bursaries for participants, a keynote speaker with honorarium and travel, the Oxford Abstracts submission and registration system, communications and promotion in English and Spanish, and proceedings publication. Host institutions coordinate local logistics while working collaboratively with MSU and the broader Planning Committee to create a unified symposium experience across all three sites.

Institutions interested in hosting should contact the Symposium co-chairs to request the External Host Institution Proposal Document, which outlines detailed hosting requirements and expectations.
