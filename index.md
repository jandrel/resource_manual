In 2025, MSU Global DH Symposium celebrated its 10th anniversary. This website and resource manual emerged from conversations around preserving the symposium's institutional memory and ensuring its continuity. We also wanted to share our learning and know-how in organizing a truly global digital humanities symposium that actively centers marginalized communities in this field.

The MSU Global DH Symposium Resource Manual documents key information, procedures, and processes needed to run the symposium. This public site serves as both a guide for future GDHS organizers and collaborators, and a resource for anyone interested in learning from our decade of experience.
